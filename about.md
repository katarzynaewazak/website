**Katarzyna Ewa Żak**

photographer, cinematographer, visual artist

Katarzyna Ewa Żak is a photographer and cinematographer working at the intersection of film, documentary, and visual art. Her imagery is defined by subtle storytelling, sensitivity to natural light, and an intimate presence of the human subject. She is drawn to what is fleeting – quiet moments in between, often overlooked by everyday perception.

She holds a degree in Philosophy from the University of Warsaw and graduated from the Krzysztof Kieślowski Film School in Katowice. She is currently a student at the Institute of Creative Photography (ITF) in Opava, Czech Republic.

In 2025, she was awarded **Photo of the Year** and **1st Prize in the People – Stories category** at the Grand Press Photo competition. Her work was recognized for its emotional depth, gentle observation, and atmospheric use of light.

She lives and works in Warsaw, collaborating on personal projects as well as commissions for cultural institutions, individual clients, and commercial partners. At the core of her practice is the human being – not as a subject, but as a presence.
